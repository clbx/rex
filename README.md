!Heavy WIP!

Rex is a self-hostable game library to organize, display, and make games accessible. 

Rex is mostly focued on ROMs, but technically has support for any game or software

Current Development Plan (0.1):
- [ ] Get Game Identification Working for a few platforms (N64, GCN, Wii)
- [ ] Create framework for configuration, caching, and basic API functions

- [ ] Create MVP API for usage. 

Development Goals:
- [ ] Full frontend for game browsing with filters like platform, genre, etc. 
- [ ] Featured UI with Images, Game Descriptions, Videos, etc. A one stop shop for information about the game.
- [ ] Support for retroarch or some kind of web hosted emulator frontends for platforms that can would be able to run in a browser. 
- [ ] Easy to use container 
- [ ] Highly configurable
